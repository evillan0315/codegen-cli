## Features

- **AI-Powered Code Assistance**: Leverage large language models for code generation, refactoring, and debugging suggestions.
- **File Operations**: Seamless integration with local file systems for reading and writing code.
- **Git Integration**: Basic Git operations (e.g., diff generation) to track changes.
- **User Interface**: A responsive web interface built with React to interact with the AI editor.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication for accessing the editor functionalities.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- **AI Editor Backend service running and accessible.** The CLI communicates with this service for all AI and file system operations.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/evillan0315/codegen-cli.git
    cd codegen-cli
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for the backend (root directory):**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies for the frontend (`apps/ai-editor-front`):**
    ```bash
    cd apps/ai-editor-front
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    cd ../..
    ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root and in `apps/ai-editor-front` based on the `.env.example` (if present) or refer to `docs/google-gemini-setup.md` for AI API key configuration.

Example `.env` (root):

```env
PORT=3000
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Important for CLI to connect to the backend
# AI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY # This is for the backend service, not the CLI
# AI_MODEL=gemini-pro
```

Example `.env` (`apps/ai-editor-front`):

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Usage

### Running the Backend and Frontend

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    From the project root:

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or node src/cli.ts start
    ```

    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured `PORT`).

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    From the `apps/ai-editor-front` directory:

    ```bash
    cd apps/ai-editor-front
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or Vite's default).

3.  **Access the AI Editor:**
    Navigate to the frontend URL in your web browser. You will be able to log in (if authentication is set up) and use the AI editing features.

### CLI Usage Examples

The AI Editor CLI (`aicli`) allows you to interact with the AI Editor backend directly from your terminal. Ensure your backend service is running and configured (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

For a full guide to all CLI commands and options, refer to the [CLI Usage Guide](docs/cli-usage.md).

**1. Authenticate with the Backend (Login)**

Before using `generate` or `scan`, you need to log in to the backend service. This command will open a browser for OAuth.

```bash
aicli login google
# or for GitHub
aicli login github

# Specify a different local port for the callback if 8080 is in use
aicli login google --port 8081
```

**2. Check Authenticated User**

Verify who is currently logged in.

```bash
aicli whoami
```

**3. Scan Project Files**

Scan files and directories to understand the project structure. This delegates to the backend.

```bash
# Scan the current directory and its subdirectories
aicli scan

# Scan specific files or directories
aicli scan src tests/unit

# Scan verbosely and show content snippets
aicli scan --verbose --show-content src/utils.ts
```

**4. Generate or Modify Code**

Instruct the AI to generate or modify code based on a natural language prompt. This is the core functionality.

```bash
# Generate code based on a prompt, scanning the current directory
aicli generate "Add a new utility function to src/utils.ts that formats dates as 'YYYY-MM-DD'."

# Generate code in a specific project root, scanning specific directories
aicli generate "Refactor the authentication logic in auth/ to use a new JWT strategy." --path /path/to/my/project --scan-dirs auth

# Auto-confirm all changes (USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!)
aicli generate "Fix all linting errors in src/" --yes

# Generate changes without involving Git (no new branch, no staging)
aicli generate "Implement a new feature." --no-git

# Specify a custom branch name for Git operations
aicli generate "Improve performance of data processing" --branch perf-optimization-ai
```

**5. Log Out**

Clear your stored authentication token.

```bash
aicli logout
```
